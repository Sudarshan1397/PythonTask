# PythonTask
First File Mathematical operations of this repsitory contains mathamatical operations on two number 

a=int(input("Enter the first number:"))
Above first line of code takes the first number from user and converts its datatype from string to integer and stores it in variable name a
b=int(input("Enter the second number:"))
Above second line of code takes the second number from user and converts its datatype from string to integer and stores it in variable name b

print("Addition is",a+b)
above line simply do mathematical addition of two number that are given by user and stored into variables a and b and prints its addition as output to user 
print("Subtraction is",a-b)
above line simply do mathematical subtraction of two number that are given by user and stored into variables a and b and prints its subtraction as output to user 

print("Multiplication is",a*b)
above line simply do mathematical multiplication of two number that are given by user and stored into variables a and b and prints its multiplication as output to user 

print("Division is",a/b)
above line simply do mathematical division of two number that are given by user and stored into variables a and b and prints its division as output to user .


This is the second Files Description

fname=input("Enter your first name: ")
This first line of code shows Text from the input function and takes input of user its first name and then stores in variable fname
lname=input("Enter your last name: ")
This first line of code shows Text from the input function and takes input of user its last name and then stores in variable lname

print("Hello,",fname,lname,"! Welcome to Python programa.")
This line prints some Prewritten text and users first name and last name stored in variables and show user
